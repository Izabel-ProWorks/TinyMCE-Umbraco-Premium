This is an Umbraco CMS package that enables access to the paid features in the TinyMCE-based Rich Text Editor (RTE) in version 12+ with a license. It also adds a new TinyMCE Premium property editor with additional settings, providing a more targeted configuration setup for RTE Data Types in Umbraco. Finally, it allows for additional settings that support JSON directly in the configuration for .NET (appsettings.config).
